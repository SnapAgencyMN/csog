            <p>This tool uses information about the users, site and system to create a customized owner’s guide for the septic system.  To fully utilize this customization some key information needs to be entered.  The data entry will move more quickly if you gather the known information prior to starting a project.  If you do not have this information, research should be done with the permitting authority, current or previous property owner or septic system professionals who have been involved with the system such as the designer, installer or pumper. </p>

    <div>
        <ul class="square">
            <li><b> There are 3 ways to conduct a search: </b></li>
            <br />
            <ul class="circle">
                <li>By the Project name. For example, searching for the Project ‘Big Springs Pleasant View’ would result in a list of Projects using any of those words.</li>
                <br />
                <li>By property ID#. Property ID number refers to the local taxing authority property, or Parcel, ID number (usually a string of a sequence of numbers).</li>
                <br />
                <li>By ZIP Code. NOTE: be particularly careful if you live in an area with multiple codes.</li>
                <li style='list-style-type:none'>You can search for USPS ZIP codes at: <a class='underline' href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action">https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>IF no search results are generated, you will be prompted to check your spelling, check the ID# or the ZIP code.</li>

    <br />
    <h2 class='accordionHeader'>Template Tips</h2>
    <div>
        <p> The Tool is designed for use with single property or multiple properties such as a subdivision community system. In that event you may prefer to create a Template which includes all the basic data that will apply to all systems but can be reused and tailored to each individual one.</p>
        <br />
        <p> By default many of the entries are required.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To create, for example a “Sunny Side Subdivision” Template - just enter ‘in progress’ or 'template' in the required fields. Then copy the Sunny Side Template to enter specific information for each property and rename: i.e. “Sunny Side - Smith Property. ID# 1111”</p>
